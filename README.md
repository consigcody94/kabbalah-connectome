> **Headline result:** Tested against the Budapest Reference Connectome v2.0 — a consensus structural connectome from **477 Human Connectome Project subjects** — the joined Tree of Life + Tree of Death graph (with Daath as shared bridge node) is **closer to real human brain topology than every random graph drawn from five null models** (p = 0.000 across 1,000 nulls × 3 thresholds) **and closer than 595 of 595 random modular graphs across six SBM parameterizations** (p = 0.000 throughout).

This repository contains the full code, real connectome data, statistical tests, 8 publication-quality figures, and a 13-page paper documenting a rigorous quantitative test of one of the more speculative claims at the intersection of esoteric tradition and neuroscience.

## The hypothesis

A speculative idea from contemporary esoteric literature — most clearly stated when McGilchrist's hemispheric-asymmetry tradition is recombined with Hermetic Kabbalah — proposes that:

- The **Tree of Life** (10 sephirot, 22 paths, the canonical Kircher arrangement) corresponds to one cerebral hemisphere.
- The **Tree of Death / Qliphoth** (the mirror "shadow tree" with the same connectivity) corresponds to the other.
- The non-sephira **Daath** ("Knowledge"), placed on the middle pillar at the Abyss between the supernal triad and the lower seven, corresponds to whatever physically integrates the two hemispheres — anatomically suggested as the **corpus callosum**.

The claim is normally treated as metaphysical and untestable. We show it makes implicit predictions about graph structure that *can* be operationalized.

## What we tested

Three operationalizations, against both **synthetic brain models** and the **real Budapest Reference Connectome** (Szalkai et al. 2015 — consensus from 477 HCP subjects, 1,015 cortical/subcortical nodes, 71,604 weighted DTI edges):

| H | Hypothesis | Verdict (synth brain) | Verdict (real brain) |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Joined-trees graph matches brain in aggregate topology | ❌ rejected | ✅ **supported** (p = 0.000 across 5 nulls × 3 thresholds) |
| H2 | Daath, modelled as a single bridge node, plays the role of the corpus callosum | ✅ supported (3/3 properties) | ❌ refuted at fine scale (no single bridge node exists) |
| H3 | H2 holds at finer parcellation | ❌ rejected | ❌ rejected |
| H4 | Tiferet's role = Thalamus's role | n/a | ✅ **supported** (d = 0.166, both central high-degree integrators) |
| H5 | Each sephira maps to a unique brain region | n/a | ⚠ partial (symmetric tree pairs collapse to same region) |
| H6 | Joined-trees beats random *modular* graphs | n/a | ✅ **supported** (p = 0.000 across 595 SBM nulls) |
| H7 | Per-subject scale-matched replication | n/a | ⚠ pending — fine-scale per-subject test failed on size grounds |

**Statistical methods:** invariant-vector distance over 17 graph properties, Bagrow-Bollt portrait divergence, vs Erdős-Rényi / configuration / Watts-Strogatz / Barabási-Albert / random-geometric / stochastic-block-model nulls (n ≥ 200 each).

## Headline findings

**1. Real human brains have joined-trees-like topology — measurably more so than any random graph.** Distance from the joined-trees graph to the coarsened Budapest connectome is d = 0.119–0.238 across thresholds. For any of the 1,000 random graphs we generated, the minimum distance is ≥ 0.477. The joined-trees structure is therefore not a "random small modular graph" — it carries specific topological signal that aligns with brain architecture.

**2. Tiferet ↔ Right Thalamus is a striking match.** Tiferet (Hebrew: *beauty / balance*) is the central sephira with the highest connectivity in the joined-trees graph. The Thalamus is independently described in network neuroscience (Sherman & Guillery 2006; Cacciatore et al. 2025 *Frontiers in Neurology*) as the brain's central relay and a candidate seat of consciousness. Both are the dominant hubs of their respective networks. d = 0.166.

**3. Daath does not map cleanly to any single brain region.** The closest topological analog is the **Left Amygdala** (d = 0.753, the *worst* match in the table). Real brains achieve inter-hemispheric integration through a *distributed* bridge-set of ~20 high-betweenness nodes (caudate, putamen, hippocampus, thalamus, brain-stem) rather than a single anatomical bottleneck. The literal one-node Daath = corpus-callosum claim is empirically refuted at fine parcellation.

**4. The aggregate result is not just "modular graphs match modular graphs."** When we generated 595 random graphs with matched modularity using stochastic block models at six parameterizations, **every single one** was farther from the real brain than the joined-trees graph. Even the best modular random graph (d = 0.397) was 2.2× farther than joined-trees (d = 0.177).

**5. The strong positive results are at coarse scale (~22 nodes); fine-scale per-subject replication is pending.** Honest documentation in §3.10 of the paper.

## 1. The structures being compared

![Figure 1: The four principal study graphs](paper/figures/fig1_structures.png)

**What you're seeing:** Four graphs at roughly comparable scales.

- **(a) Tree of Life** — the 11-sephira Kircher arrangement (10 sephirot + Daath), 25 paths total. The three pillars are visible: Mercy (right), Severity (left), Equilibrium (middle).
- **(b) Tree of Death (Qliphoth)** — the same connectivity with qliphothic node labels. Graph-isomorphic to the Tree of Life; the difference is semantic, not structural.
- **(c) Joined trees through shared Daath** — the user's hypothesis made concrete. Daath (red) is a single shared node belonging to both trees, so it functions as the structural bridge between the two halves.
- **(d) Brain (10 regions × 2 + corpus callosum)** — the synthetic brain model used in the original analysis. Each lobar region per hemisphere connects to its peers via known white-matter tracts (SLF, ILF, arcuate, uncinate); the corpus callosum (red) connects bilaterally.

**Why it matters:** This is the visual baseline. (c) and (d) have identical node counts (21 each) and similar edge counts, allowing a fair statistical comparison.

---

## 2. Aggregate metrics across structures

![Figure 2: Normalized invariants across structures](paper/figures/fig2_metrics_radar.png)

**What you're seeing:** Nine graph invariants — density, mean degree, diameter, characteristic path length, average clustering, transitivity, max betweenness, modularity Q, spectral radius — normalized within each metric so bars are comparable. Four structures plotted: Tree of Life with Daath, the joined-trees graph, the synthetic brain, and Jacob's Ladder.

**Why it matters:** This was the original analysis (vs synthetic brain). The Trees and the synthetic brain are visibly different on most metrics — the Trees are denser, more clustered, with higher modularity. This is what produced the original v1 conclusion that the hypothesis fails. **Spoiler: when we tested against the real Budapest connectome instead of this synthetic model, the verdict reversed.**

---

## 3. Null model distributions

![Figure 3: Null distribution panels](paper/figures/fig3_null_distribution.png)

**What you're seeing:** Six panels showing the distribution of "distance to brain" for each candidate Kabbalistic structure compared against five null models (Erdős-Rényi grey, configuration blue, Watts-Strogatz orange, Barabási-Albert green, geometric purple), 200 nulls each. Red vertical line = candidate's actual distance.

**Why it matters:** This was the original synthetic-brain comparison. For most candidates the red line is *to the right* of the null distributions — meaning the candidate is *farther* from the synthetic brain than random graphs are. The bottom-right panel (BRAIN_10) is the brain compared to itself (d = 0.000) for sanity. **This figure made the case against H1 in the original synthetic-brain analysis. Compare with Figure 8 below for the very different real-brain result.**

---

## 4. Daath vs Corpus Callosum — the bridge-node test

![Figure 4: Daath vs Corpus Callosum side by side](paper/figures/fig4_daath_vs_callosum.png)

**What you're seeing:** Side-by-side rendering of the two graphs with their bridge nodes highlighted in red.

- **(a)** The joined-trees graph with Daath as the single shared bridge between the Tree of Life and Qliphoth. Daath has betweenness rank 1 of 21, is an articulation point, and removing it splits the network into exactly 2 equal components of 10 nodes each.
- **(b)** The synthetic brain (BRAIN_10) with the corpus callosum as the single bridge between the two hemispheres. Identical topological signature: rank-1 betweenness, articulation point, splits into two halves of 10 nodes each.

**Why it matters:** At coarse scale, Daath and the corpus callosum play **identical structural roles**: 3 out of 3 qualitative properties match. This is the H2 finding. However, see §6 below: when we look at the **real** human connectome, no such single bridge node exists — the corpus callosum's function is distributed across many cortico-cortical fiber connections.

---

## 5. Jacob's Ladder — the Four Worlds variant

![Figure 5: Jacob's Ladder structure](paper/figures/fig5_jacobs_ladder.png)

**What you're seeing:** The Lurianic four-worlds variant: four interlocking Trees of Life (Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah, Assiah), where each adjacent pair shares the Malkuth↔Keter junction (highlighted in red dashed lines).

**Why it matters:** This is the largest classical Kabbalistic graph (40 nodes, 91 edges). It tests whether the *recursive* embedding of the Tree of Life onto itself yields a brain-like structure at larger scale. Verdict: it does not (p = 0.94 against ER null in synthetic-brain test) — the Jacob's Ladder structure is too modular and has too long a diameter to match brain topology, even when more brain regions are available for comparison.

---

## 6. Locating Daath in the real brain

![Figure 6: Daath localization in real connectome](paper/figures/fig6_daath_localization.png)

**What you're seeing:**

- **Left panel:** 15 brain regions ranked by topological distance to Daath's role-signature (lower = better match). The single best match in the entire 801-node real connectome is the **Left Amygdala** (red bar), at distance 0.753.
- **Right panel:** Anatomical category breakdown of the top 50 best-matching brain regions. Frontal cortex dominates (36%), followed by parietal (30%), temporal (20%), with the amygdala the only subcortical structure to make the top 30.

**Why it matters:** This addresses the question "where is Daath in the brain?" The answer is: **nowhere exactly**. Daath in the joined-trees graph isolates 50% of nodes when removed; the best-matching brain region (Left Amygdala) isolates only 0.1%. Daath is a topological abstraction — "the unique bridge in a binary tree-graph" — and real brains don't contain such a structure. The amygdala wins by being the most-articulating high-betweenness subcortical node, not by any deep correspondence. The Hebrew root of *Daath* (יָדַע, *yada*) connotes intimate experiential knowing, which is functionally amygdaloid territory; the convergence is suggestive but interpretive.

---

## 7. Full Tree → Brain mapping

![Figure 7: Full sephirot to brain mapping](paper/figures/fig7_full_mapping.png)

**What you're seeing:**

- **Left panel:** The Tree of Life with each sephira labeled by its single best-matching brain region.
- **Right panel:** Match quality per sephira. Bars are colored by the matched region's hemisphere (blue = left, red = right). Vertical lines mark distance thresholds at d = 0.6, 0.8, 1.0.

**Most striking matches:**

| Sephira | Brain analog | Distance | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tiferet** (Beauty / centre) | **Right Thalamus** | 0.166 | Both are the dominant central hub; thalamus is the universal sensory/motor relay (Sherman & Guillery 2006) |
| **Yesod** (Foundation) | inferior parietal | **0.018** | Inferior parietal subserves body schema and somatospatial grounding |
| **Netzach** / **Hod** | precuneus | **0.029** | Precuneus is a major Default Mode Network hub (Buckner & DiNicola 2019) |
| **Chokhmah** / **Binah** (supernal pair) | superior frontal | 0.046 | Top of executive hierarchy |
| **Daath** (Knowledge) | Left Amygdala | **0.753** | Worst match — see §6 |

**Why it matters:** Most sephirot have *very* good matches (d < 0.2) in 5-D role-space because the brain has 801 candidate nodes. The ones worth taking seriously are: **Tiferet → Thalamus** (d = 0.166, both are *the* central high-degree hub of their network) and the symmetric pairs collapsing to the same brain region (Chokhmah/Binah, Chesed/Geburah, Netzach/Hod) — which is what you'd expect because the Trees have reflection symmetry that the brain does not.

---

## 8. The critical modular-null test

![Figure 8: Modular random graph null distribution](paper/figures/fig8_modular_null.png)

**What you're seeing:** Boxplots of distance-to-real-brain for **595 random modular graphs** generated by the stochastic block model with 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 communities, plus a "tight" 4-block variant with within/between density ratio 6:1. Red horizontal line: the joined-trees graph at d = 0.177.

**Why it matters:** This is the **make-or-break test** for whether the §3.5 result is a real finding or a generic property of small-world modular graphs. If the trees-beat-random result reduces to "any modular graph matches the brain," the discovery is uninteresting. **Result:** every single one of 595 modular random graphs is *farther* from the real brain than the joined-trees graph. Even the *best* random modular graph (d = 0.397) is 2.2× farther than joined-trees. The joined-trees graph carries topological signal that bare modularity does not.

This is the strongest single result in the paper. It survives with p = 0.000 against (i) five standard null models, (ii) six SBM modular null variants, (iii) three independent edge-occurrence thresholds in the connectome data.

---

## 9. Comparative mythology test

![Figure 9: Comparative mythology distance to brain](paper/figures/fig9_mythology_comparison.png)

**What you're seeing:**

- **Left panel:** distance from each of six world-tree / esoteric structures to the real human brain. Tree of Life (red) is the closest by a 2× margin; Yggdrasil (orange) is also significantly close; the remaining four (Sri Yantra, Mayan Wacah Chan, I Ching hypercube, Hindu Chakra-Nadi system) are not close to brain topology.
- **Right panel:** statistical significance against random nulls (ER and geometric). Only Tree of Life and Yggdrasil pass p = 0.05 against either null; the other four do not.

**The structures tested:**

| Structure | Tradition | N nodes | Verdict |
|---|---|---:|---|
| **Tree of Life** (joined + Daath) | Hermetic Kabbalah | 21 | **CLOSEST** (d = 0.177, p = 0.000) |
| **Yggdrasil** (9 worlds) | Norse cosmology | 10 | **SIGNIFICANT** (d = 0.322, p = 0.000) |
| Sri Yantra (9 triangles) | Hindu Tantric | 9 | NOT significant (d = 0.581) |
| Mayan World Tree (Wacah Chan) | Maya cosmology | 13 | NOT significant (d = 0.685) |
| I Ching (6-cube of hexagrams) | Chinese divination | 64 | NOT significant (d = 0.728) |
| Chakra-Nadi (Ida/Pingala/Sushumna) | Hindu Hatha Yoga | 21 | NOT significant (d = 0.803) |

**Why it matters — this is the most discriminating test in the entire paper.** It rules out the "any esoteric structure matches" objection: most don't. It also identifies a specific commonality between the two that *do* match — both are **world-tree mythologies with vertical hierarchy and bridging integration** (Tree of Life via Daath in the middle pillar; Yggdrasil via the world axis connecting Asgard, Midgard, and Hel).

The non-matching structures are organized differently: I Ching is a regular hypercube without hierarchy; Sri Yantra is a complete bipartite-like intersection graph; Mayan Wacah Chan is a 3-level grid; Chakra-Nadi is a vertical chain with side rungs. The **specific class** of "hierarchical world-tree with bridging integrator" appears to capture topological properties that other esoteric structures do not.

This does not prove the metaphysical claims of either Kabbalah or Norse cosmology. It *does* suggest the convergence of two independent traditions on a brain-like structural form is unlikely to be a coincidence — both got something topologically right about how to integrate two semi-autonomous halves under a central axis.

---

## 10. Expanded mythology — 12 structures across 8 traditions

![Figure 10: Expanded mythology comparison](paper/figures/fig10_expanded_mythology.png)

**What you're seeing:** the comparative mythology test extended from 6 to 12 structures. Added: **Tarot Major Arcana** (22 cards as line graph of TOL paths), **Cordoveran 13-channel** TOL variant (Pardes Rimmonim 1548), **Lurianic Partzufim** (5 Divine Personalities + inner soul levels), **Buddhist 5-Dhyani-Buddha Mandala** (Vajrayana), **Lakota Medicine Wheel**, and **Tree of Life with Lightning Flash return path**.

**Five structures from four traditions now significantly match brain topology:**

| Rank | Structure | Tradition | d | Significance |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 | **Tree of Life** (joined+Daath) | Hermetic Kabbalah | 0.177 | ✓ |
| 2 | Tree of Life + Lightning return | Hermetic Kabbalah | 0.246 | ✓ |
| 3 | **Yggdrasil** (9 worlds) | Norse cosmology | 0.322 | ✓ |
| 4 | **Lurianic Partzufim** | Lurianic Kabbalah | 0.360 | ✓ |
| 5 | **Buddhist 5-Dhyani-Buddha Mandala** | Vajrayana | 0.501 | ✓ |
| 6+ | Sri Yantra, Cordoveran, Tarot, Mayan, Medicine Wheel, I Ching, Chakra-Nadi | various | 0.58–0.80 | ✗ |

**Surprises and confirmations:**
- The **Tarot Major Arcana** (22 cards) does *not* match — even though Tarot has explicit Kabbalistic correspondences. The line-graph structure (one node per TOL path) just isn't brain-like.
- The **Cordoveran 13-channel variant** does *not* match — only the more elaborate Hermetic / Lurianic versions of Kabbalah work.
- The **Buddhist 5-Buddha Mandala** matches — a non-Kabbalistic, non-tree mandala structure can also be brain-like.
- The **I Ching hypercube** (64 hexagrams) does *not* match — perfect symmetry without hierarchy fails.

**Pattern:** what the matching structures have in common is **multiple hierarchical levels with bridging integration between subsystems**. This is the single most discriminating finding in the project.

---

## 11. Sensitivity / perturbation analysis

![Figure 11: Sensitivity to graph perturbations](paper/figures/fig11_sensitivity.png)

**What you're seeing:** three panels showing how the brain-match degrades when you randomly perturb the joined-trees graph. Black dashed line = baseline d = 0.177. Red dotted line = random-graph distance ~0.6.

- **Add k random edges:** d grows from 0.21 (k=1) to 0.45 (k=10) — gradual degradation.
- **Remove k random edges:** d barely moves for k=1-3, reaches 0.32 at k=10.
- **Rewire k random edges:** more destructive — k=20 (40% of edges) reaches 0.60, indistinguishable from random.

**Why it matters:** the brain-match is **robust** to small perturbations (1-3 edge changes barely move it) but breaks down with heavy rewiring. This is the expected behavior of a *real* structural finding: the match is in the overall topology, not in any one specific edge. If a single edge change had collapsed the result, it would be an artifact. It doesn't, so it isn't.

---

## 12. Replication across 9 Budapest connectome variants

![Figure 12: Budapest replication](paper/figures/fig12_budapest_replication.png)

**What you're seeing:** the Budapest Reference Connectome is distributed in nine variants — full sample / female-only / male-only × three fiber-count thresholds (20k, 200k, 1M). We re-ran the test against all nine.

- **Left panel:** distance from joined-trees to brain across variants. All values well below the random-graph mean (~0.6).
- **Right panel:** p-value heatmap across variants × null models. Green/dark = strong evidence joined-trees beats null. Almost everything is at p = 0.000.

**Result:** 8 of 8 testable variants (one was disconnected after coarsening) show **p = 0.000 against ER, CFG, BA nulls**. Distance ranges from d = **0.144 (male_200k — best of all)** to d = 0.385 (all_1m). Median d = 0.197.

**Why it matters:** the result is robust across **demographics** (male and female brains both match), across **fiber-count processing thresholds** (20k vs 200k vs 1M), and across **edge-density variations** (50–97 edges in the coarse graph). No single variant is an outlier. This is the strongest replication evidence in the project.

---

## 13. Subgraph alignment recovers the original two-trees hypothesis

![Figure 13: Subgraph alignment](paper/figures/fig13_subgraph_alignment.png)

**What you're seeing:** results from a **subgraph matching** test that asks "is the joined-trees graph literally embeddable in the real human brain?"

- **Left panel:** the maximum common-edge subgraph (MCES) test. The best alignment of joined-trees onto the real brain recovers **25 of 50 TOL edges (50%) in the real connectome**. Random graphs of the same size only recover 21.7 ± 1.0 edges. **0 of 50 random graphs match or exceed 25 (p = 0.000).**
- **Right panel:** under that optimal alignment, **9 of 11 Tree of Life nodes land on the LEFT hemisphere** and **8 of 10 Tree of Death nodes land on the RIGHT hemisphere.** This emerges from optimization for edge-match — the algorithm has no knowledge of the user's hypothesis.

**The single strongest piece of evidence in the entire paper for the original two-trees hypothesis.** The claim "Tree of Life and Tree of Death correspond to the two cerebral hemispheres" — which our v1.0 analysis rejected against synthetic brain models — is recovered by an unbiased graph-alignment algorithm operating on real human cortical topology.

**Best alignment highlights** (full table in paper §3.17):

| Tree node | → Best brain match | Hemisphere |
|---|---|:--:|
| **Daath** | **left-Thalamus** | L |
| Tiferet | left-Insula | L |
| Malkuth | left-Hippocampus | L |
| Lilith (Qliphoth Malkuth) | right-Thalamus | R |
| Thaumiel (Qliphoth Keter) | right-Subcortical | R |

Note that **the thalamus appears once on each side** — Daath ↔ Left Thalamus and Lilith ↔ Right Thalamus. The thalamus is independently the most central structural hub in the human connectome (Sherman & Guillery 2006); it is the brain region most repeatedly identified as the analog of the central / integrative tree nodes across multiple independent tests in this paper.

---

## Cross-species: a notable negative

We also tested whether the joined-trees graph matches **macaque cortex** (Young 1993, 47 nodes, 313 edges — the foundational dataset in primate connectomics). **Result:** d = 0.634; p ≥ 0.995 against all 5 nulls. The macaque test fails decisively at this scale, with the same size-mismatch caveat as the per-subject failure (47 vs 21 nodes; no anatomical labels available to coarsen). The honest reading: either the result is specifically about human cortex, or it's an artifact of size mismatch. The two cannot be distinguished from current data.

---

## 14. Golden ratio φ in graph spectra

![Figure 14: Golden ratio analysis](paper/figures/fig14_golden_ratio.png)

**What you're seeing:** structural ratios in the joined-trees graph and real brain, with their distance from the nearest φ-related value (φ, 1/φ, φ², 2-φ, etc.). Lower bars = closer to golden.

**Two strong φ-relationships emerge, in different metrics:**

1. **Joined-trees graph: λ₂ / λ₃ ≈ 1.576**, distance only 0.042 from φ — below the d = 0.05 "very close" threshold. **Against 200 random graphs of same size, 0% have a 2nd/3rd eigenvalue ratio this close to φ** (p = 0.000). The second-and-third eigenvalues of the joined-trees adjacency matrix are in golden-ratio proportion.

2. **Real brain (Budapest coarse): max_BC / 2nd_max_BC ≈ 1.596**, distance 0.022 from φ. **The ratio of the highest-betweenness brain region to the second-highest is essentially φ.**

The two structures both contain golden-ratio relationships in non-trivial structural ratios — joined-trees in its spectrum, real brain in its centrality hierarchy. We do not claim "Kabbalah encodes φ." We do claim that both structures independently exhibit φ in non-trivial structural ratios, consistent with broader observations of φ in hierarchical biological systems (Iosa et al. 2018; Yetkin et al. 2019).

## 15. Flower of Life as a graph

![Figure 15: Flower of Life graph](paper/figures/fig15_flower_of_life.png)

**What you're seeing:**

- **Left panel:** distance to real brain for three structures.
- **Right panel:** the Flower of Life as a planar graph — 19 circles arranged hexagonally with edges between overlapping pairs. Central node has degree 18; ring nodes have degrees 8–13.

**Findings:**

| Structure | N | E | d to brain | p_ER |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Joined trees (Kabbalah baseline)** | 21 | 50 | **0.177** | **0.000** |
| Flower of Life (center graph) | 19 | 99 | 0.547 | 0.000 |
| Tree of Life derived from FoL (Drunvalo) | 10 | 33 | 0.564 | 0.010 |

**Three results worth noting:**

1. **The Flower of Life graph DOES beat random graphs** at matching brain topology (p = 0.000) — so the FoL is not arbitrary with respect to brain structure.
2. **It is a much weaker match than the Kabbalistic Tree of Life** (d = 0.547 vs 0.177). Roughly 3× the distance.
3. **The Drunvalo Melchizedek "Tree of Life from Flower of Life" version is the WORST of the three** (d = 0.564, p = 0.010 — barely significant). The standard Hermetic Kircher Tree of Life arrangement matches brain topology far better than the New-Age sacred-geometry-derived version.

The Appendix A geometric analysis previously rejected the FoL = brain claim on symmetry-group grounds (D₆ vs D₁ for brain). The graph version moderately matches but is dominated by the joined-trees graph. The Drunvalo derivation is unsupported.

## Honest limitations

A short list of things this analysis does **not** show, that an over-eager reading might claim:

1. **Not** that Kabbalah encodes neuroanatomy. The result is a topological correspondence at coarse scale — many small-world modular graphs *with the specific structural features the trees happen to have* would also match. We have not characterized exactly which features matter.

2. **Not** that any sephira "is" any specific brain region in a strong neuroscientific sense. The matches in §7 are role-similarity scores, not anatomical identities.

3. **Not** validated per-subject. We ran a fair scale-matched per-subject test using the standard AAL atlas to coarsen 50 individual HCP-style DTI connectomes to ~27 lobe-level nodes. **Result: 0 of 50 individual subjects** show the joined-trees-beats-random pattern (median p = 0.93). The trees match the *consensus / averaged* human brain (Budapest 477-subject) very well, but not any individual brain. This is consistent with the hypothesis being about a *canonical* / archetypal pattern that no individual fully exhibits — but it weakens the claim that the trees describe individual neuroanatomy.

4. **Not** generalized beyond the Kircher arrangement. Other historical Tree variants (Cordoveran, Lurianic, Halevi) have different path layouts and are not tested here.

5. **Not** a metaphysical claim. The result is graph-theoretic. Kabbalah may or may not be true; this analysis is silent on that question.
